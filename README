# Powershell Profile

This is a simple powershell profile that I use as my daily driver. I originally was using Chris Titus's profile, but it has extremely long load times due to it pulling and updating on every load.

## Whats included

- Linux like aliases
- Oh-My-Posh
- zoxide
- fzf

All of the dependancies are automatically installed on initialization through winget. Always make sure you look into the script you are running.

## How to use

Download the `Micrsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` & `linux_aliases.ps1` and place them into:
`C:\Users\YOUR USER\Documents\Powershell` folder.

**If you wish to use my custom theme based off hul10 & dracula color scheme**
Then you download the `custom.omp.json` and place it into your _oh-my-posh_ themes folder. You could also modify line _68_, to use a file in your Powershell folder.

## Notes

I am using powershell 7
